        <p>Sound in video is generally taken for granted. Usually, the viewer talks about the story, the visual fx, the acting and all those important aspects of a video production. However, sound is often overlooked. The role of audio in video is so important for the viewing experience that if done wrong, it for sure will affect the whole product. Sound is that ingredient that helps to tell the story more effectively. Sound helps to connect the viewer's emotions with what they are watching.</p><br>

<h4>The Pantheon (Re-Sound Design)</h4>
				<div class="sound-description">
<p>All the original audio from this film was removed and then we recorded our own from scratch in the studio for the sound design class BECA530 at San Francisco State University, in 2023.
My contribution to the project was composing and mixing the music, recording, editing & mixing. For the music score, I wanted something epic but also as at the beginning of the movie the scenes were more suspense-like, I felt there had to be more protagonism in the sound design and foley work. This strategy helped to create the necessary tension that would prepare the viewer for the final scene, The battle. For this personal mix version, I added extra components such as foley layers, a male voice, and the master of the final mix.</p>

<h4>Ascension (Re-Sound Design)</h4>
		  <div class="Description">
			  <div class="sound-description">
<p>It was fun working on all the aspects of Sound Design, SFX, V.O. and music composition of this project. When you start working on the Foley of a film, you realize that for example SFX for foot steps on the snow do not necessarily have to be recorded on the snow and certainly not with your feet. You would be surprised how sometimes the least imagined material works just fine for what you need. Ascension is a short animated film created by Thomas B. at Supinfocom studios. France. The re-sound design of this video is used only for educational purposes and only aims to inspire and support the original sound design and music content.</p>

<h4>Check Mate (Re-Sound Design)</h4>
<div class="sound-description">
<p>When I saw this story it really impacted me.  It was the perfect opportunity to explore a more obscure theme where the music could drive the different sensations the protagonist was going through due to the guilt she was carrying. I will not give you more spoilers though, so you can watch it yourself. This re-sound design of TSUME was made in collaboration with Anmichaelle Yabut in the Electronic Music program at the College of San Mateo. Check Mate is an adaptation from the original short animated film called TSUME from Supinfocom by David Broner, Kevin Cordier-Royer, Tristan Jaegly, Vincent Touache, Chien-Chang Wu, Jake Delamare. This adaptation is used only for educational purposes and only aims to inspire and support the original sound design and music content.</p>
